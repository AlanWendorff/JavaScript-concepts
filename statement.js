// In JavaScript we can think the the statements like a sentence in english.

// In english every sentence ends with a dot.
// In JavaScript every statement ends with semicolon;

// In JavaScript the semicolon indicates the end of an instruction, it's possible write the instructions continuously but is messy and it's not a good practice.

// The Statement is an action that JavaScript executes to make things happen and to continue the logic of the program.
